# Javascript-Step-By-Step

A structured learning repository for mastering JavaScript without skipping fundamentals. This repo starts with core language mechanics and steadily moves toward real-world patterns used in modern applications.

The emphasis is on understanding before frameworks.

What you’ll learn

-Language fundamentals: variables, types, scope, coercion

- Functions: closures, higher-order functions, immutability
- Execution model: call stack, heap, event loop
- Asynchronous JavaScript: callbacks, promises, async/await
- Objects & prototypes: this, prototype chain, classes (and what they really are)
- Arrays & iteration: map/filter/reduce done right
- Error handling: sync vs async errors
- Modules: ES modules, imports/exports
- Modern syntax: destructuring, spread, optional chaining
- Performance basics: reference vs value, memory traps
- Writing testable, predictable code

## Repo structure

- `01-basics/`
- `02-types-and-coercion/`
- `03-functions-and-scope/`
- `04-closures/`
- `05-objects-and-prototypes/`
- `06-arrays-and-iteration/`
- `07-async-javascript/`
- `08-event-loop/`
- `09-modules/`
- `10-error-handling/`
- `11-modern-javascript/`
- `12-common-pitfalls/`

## Each folder contains:

- Small focused examples
- Explanatory comments
- Exercises with increasing difficulty
- Edge cases and “why this works” notes

## How to use this repo

- Start from 01-basics
- Read the code, not just the output
- Modify examples and break them on purpose
- Move forward only when you can predict what the code will do

## Philosophy

- No magic, no skipped steps
- Prefer mental models over memorization
- Explain why, not just how
- Treat JavaScript as a language, not a toolbox

## Who this is for

- Beginners who want solid foundations
- Developers confused by JavaScript “weirdness”
- Frontend engineers preparing for frameworks
- Interview preparation focused on fundamentals

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome:

- New examples
- Better explanations
- Edge cases and pitfalls
- Corrections with clear reasoning
