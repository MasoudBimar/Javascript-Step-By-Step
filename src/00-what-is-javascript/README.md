# What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a general-purpose programming language most known for running in web browsers, but it is also used in:

- Web apps and mobile apps
- Real-time networking apps
- Command-line tools
- Games

## Where Does JavaScript Code Run?

JavaScript was originally designed to run in web browsers.

Every browser includes a JavaScript engine that executes JS code:

- Firefox: SpiderMonkey
- Chrome: V8

In 2009, Ryan Dahl embedded the V8 engine in a C++ program to create Node.js.

Node.js is a C++ program that includes Google’s V8 JavaScript engine.

## What Is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## JavaScript vs ECMAScript

ECMAScript is the language specification, and JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to this specification.

Ecma International is the organization responsible for the standard.

The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.

Since 2015, new ECMAScript specifications have been released yearly.

## JavaScript Versions

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.

JavaScript became an ECMA standard in 1997.

ECMAScript is the official name of the specification.

Older versions are abbreviated as ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.

Starting in 2015, ECMAScript versions are named by year (for example: ECMAScript 2015).
